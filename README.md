STEP 1: There are two folders inside the /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ folder:
  
  One for files captured from Henry and one for files captured from Ruth.
  
Use the preview commands to determine which of the files contain readable text data.

  
  - Use the "less"  tool to preview a file in Linux to see what's inside of a file

STEP 2: Using the "Less" tool followed by the file name, see if there are read-able or non-readable text in the file

- I used the "Less" command where I was able to see the contents of do.txt, allowing me to see it does contain read-able content

STEP 3: Using the "Less" tool I found that files: spt.txt, do.txt and wp.txt had read-able content

-  - Use "rm" tool followed by the files that contained non-readable text data
